                <h4>
                    A Quick Quest adventure module adapted from an adventure from Dungeon Magazine #036
                </h4>
                <p><span class="h3">Synopsis:</span> An outcast gnome wizard has been using an illusion of a giant troll to exact a toll from travelers crossing a bridge. Recently, he burned down another nearby bridge to increase traffic. The heroes meet a child in need and must cross the river to continue on their quest.</p>
                <p class="player-text">You are on your way to _______ (e.g. the coastal town of Westbrook) to _______ (e.g. attend the market). If you make good time, you might be able to reach your destination tonight. Around mid afternoon, you come to a place where you expect to cross a bridge, but the bridge is gone. A 30-foot wide rushing river is blocking your path.</p>
                <p>The bridge has been burned. The stone footings and two stone supports in the middle of the river are still standing, but all the wood of the bridge has been turned to ash. Another path leads south along the river bank.</p>
                <div class="rolls">
                    <p><em>INT</em> + <em>EXP</em> &ge; 10: Discover the bridge was burned, if investigating.</p>
                    <p><em>INT</em> + <em>EXP</em> &ge; 15: Realize the fire was intentional. Oil was used as an accelerant.</p>
                    <p><em>INT</em> + <em>SAG</em> &ge; 10: You remember there is another bridge an hour's walk south.</p>
                    <p><em>STR</em> + <em>EXP</em> &ge; 20: Ford the river. Swept downstream toward the other bridge on failure.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="player-text">As you come around a bend in the trail, you almost collide with a young boy running in the opposite direction. He is out of breath but immediately starts babbling about seeing a troll. As he catches his breath, his story comes out. He was trying to shepherd his flock across the bridge to the south. There’s a toll on that bridge and people say that a troll guards it. He didn’t believe the stories and he didn’t have any money, he tried to just rush his flock across. The troll jumped out from under the bridge and scattered his flock. The sheep are on the other side of the bridge, but he is stuck here with no money.</p>
                <div class="rolls">
                    <p><em>WIS</em> + <em>SAG</em> &ge; 20: Realize the boy's description is even bigger and fiercer than most trolls you have heard of.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="sign" style="width: 150px; float: right;">
                    <u>Pay the toll or feed the troll</u><br />
                    People - 3 GP each<br />
                    Horses - 1 GP each<br />
                    Livestock - 1 Copper piece each
                </div>
                <p>If the party continue south, they find a stone bridge with no sign of the troll. A sign on the bridge reads:</p>
                <p>If they pay the toll before crossing the bridge, nothing will happen. Otherwise, the troll jumps out and blocks their way if they try to cross.</p>
                <p class="player-text">A huge green troll leaps out from underneath the bridge, pulling itself up with its long arms. It points at the sign and says, "pay toll or feed troll."</p>
                <p>If the players fight the troll, it will miss with every attack. It’s hard to hit, but if a player would land a successful hit, they find that their weapon passes right through the troll. It’s just an illusion.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The gnome will not confront the heroes. If they pass the bridge without paying, he might follow them and attempt to steal from them or cause magical mischief when they camp for the night. If they search for him, he will retreat into his cave and attempt to lure them into a trap.</p>
                <div class="map">
                    <img src="troll_bridge_map.png" />
                </div>
                <p class="player-text">A small cave opening is carved into the bank of the river under the far side of the bridge. As you enter it, a trap triggers! A swinging log is released from the ceiling (1). Make a <span class="normal-text">DEX + ROG &ge; 15</span> check or be knocked back into the river and suffer harm.</p>
                <p>Farther into the cave there is a hidden spike pit trap (2), a store room with leftover barrels of oil (3) and the gnome's bedroom with a chest of coins and trinkets taken from travelers (4).</p>
                <div class="rolls">
                    <p><em>WIS</em> + <em>ROG/EXP</em> &ge; 15: Notice the pit trap if searching for traps, etc.</p>
                    <p><em>STR/DEX</em> + <em>ROG/EXP</em> &ge; 15: Leap over it.</p>
                </div>
                <p>If the players defeat the gnome, they can take his gold and continue on their way. If they help the child, he might give them two sheep in thanks. There are many other possible outcomes to this adventure. It is left to the GM to resolve them in a plausible way.</p>
