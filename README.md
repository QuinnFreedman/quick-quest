Quick Quest is a one-page RPG framework by GIFFYGLYPH.COM. This repo contains files for my adaptation/expansion of that game. All images and most of the core rules are copied from GIFFYGLYPH.COM and reformatted to allow for additional content.

See the core rules [here](https://github.com/QuinnFreedman/quick-quest/blob/master/Quick%20Quest%20Core%20Rules.pdf)

There is also an example adventure based on an old andventure from Dragon Magazine [here](https://github.com/QuinnFreedman/quick-quest/blob/master/Quick%20Quest%20Adventure%20Module%20Troll%20Bridge.pdf)
